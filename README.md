# Test:

## OpenGL and GLFW

I used [OpenGL](https://crates.io/crates/gl) to draw the 3D shape and 
the [GLFW bindings for Rust](https://crates.io/crates/glfw) for creating the window

## Block Mesh

I used [Block Mesh](https://crates.io/crates/block-mesh) to optimize the rendered quads

## Commands:

- Movements: WASD
- Toggle wireframe: Enter
- Camera rotation: Arrow keys AND Mouse movement
- Show mouse: E
- Reset camera: T

## Screenshots:
